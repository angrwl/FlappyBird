# FlappyBird

This is easy to follow (and play) code of flappy bird I have written for a phone. 

You can play the game here: https://angrwl.github.io/FlappyBird/ 

It is likely that the game may not load properly therefore, the best solution is to download this whole folder and then open the `index.html` by using **Google Chrome**
